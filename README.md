# LinePaths
An Artistic Response for my math class.

# Description
This game was made for my math class in about 24 hours.

Use lines to move green cubes from the start to the finish.

Press the + button to make lines and the play button when your ready.

The trash button deletes the lines if you want to start over.

# Dev Stuff
This game was made in GameMaker Studio 2. I do not plan to update this game.
